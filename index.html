                        <h3 class="text-2xl mb-2 text-brand-teal">What is a Motion?</h3>
                        <p>A motion is the topic of the debate. It's a statement that one side (the Proposition or Government) must support, and the other side (the Opposition) must oppose. Understanding the specific wording of a motion is the most critical skill in debate, as it dictates what each team has to prove to win. Motions are typically categorized by their phrasing, which sets different burdens on the debaters.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="space-y-8">
                        <div>
                            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold font-sans text-brand-orange">THW: "This House Would..."</h4>
                            <p class="mt-1">These are <strong>policy motions</strong>. They propose a specific action or plan. The Proposition team has the burden to present a "model"—a clear, practical plan explaining how they would implement the motion. The Opposition can either argue against the policy in principle, argue that the practical outcomes will be negative, or propose a counter-model (a different plan to solve the same problem).</p>
                            <div class="mt-3 bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg border text-sm"><strong>Example:</strong> "THW ban unpaid internships."<br><strong>Proposition's Job:</strong> Propose a law to ban them, explain who would enforce it, and argue why this leads to a better, fairer world.<br><strong>Opposition's Job:</strong> Argue why this ban is a bad idea (e.g., it reduces opportunities for students) or propose a better alternative (e.g., regulating internships instead of banning them).</div>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold font-sans text-brand-teal">THBT: "This House Believes That..."</h4>
                            <p class="mt-1">These are <strong>value judgment motions</strong>. They ask teams to argue whether a statement is true or false, right or wrong. No model is required. The debate is a philosophical clash over competing values or a factual analysis of the world as it is. The Proposition must prove the statement is, on balance, true, while the Opposition must prove it is, on balance, false.</p>
                             <div class="mt-3 bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg border text-sm"><strong>Example:</strong> "THBT social media has done more harm than good."<br><strong>Proposition's Job:</strong> Prove that the negative impacts of social media (e.g., on mental health, democracy) outweigh the positive impacts (e.g., connectivity).<br><strong>Opposition's Job:</strong> Prove that the benefits outweigh the harms.</div>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold font-sans text-brand-orange">THR: "This House Regrets..."</h4>
                            <p class="mt-1">These are <strong>retrospective motions</strong>. They invite teams to evaluate a past event, trend, or decision. The Proposition must argue why the world would be better today if that thing had never happened (the "counterfactual"). The Opposition must defend the status quo, arguing that the world is better with the thing having happened. The debate is a comparison between the world as it is and a hypothetical alternative reality.</p>
                             <div class="mt-3 bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg border text-sm"><strong>Example:</strong> "THR the invention of the smartphone."<br><strong>Proposition's Job:</strong> Paint a picture of a world without smartphones and argue that this world would be preferable (e.g., better mental health, more genuine social interaction).<br><strong>Opposition's Job:</strong> Argue that the benefits of smartphones (e.g., access to information, safety) make our current world better than the counterfactual.</div>
                        </div>
                         <div>
                            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold font-sans text-brand-teal">TH, as X...: "This House, as X..."</h4>
                            <p class="mt-1">These are <strong>actor motions</strong>. They force the Proposition team to argue from the perspective of a specific person, group, or institution (e.g., "the feminist movement," "a developing nation"). All arguments must be consistent with the likely interests, values, and capabilities of that actor. The Opposition argues against the motion, but does not have to adopt a specific persona. These motions test a debater's ability to analyze stakeholder incentives deeply.</p>

                        <p>In the World Schools Debating Championships (WSDC) format, judges assess speakers on three distinct categories for substantive speeches (the first three speakers on each team). The Reply Speech is scored holistically. Understanding these categories is key to improving as a debater, as it shows you exactly what judges are looking for.</p>

                        <p>The Reply Speech is not scored on the three separate categories. Instead, it receives a single, holistic score that is half of a substantive speech score. A good reply speech (35/50) identifies the one or two key points of clash in the debate and persuasively explains why their team won those clashes. It is a biased summary, not a rebuttal speech, and should tell a compelling story of the debate from their side's perspective.</p>

                        <p>While the core principles of argumentation are universal, different debate formats have unique rules, roles, and strategies. This guide is primarily based on the <strong>World Schools Debating Championships (WSDC)</strong> format, as its 3-vs-3 structure and focus on clear, substantive debate provide a strong foundation for most other styles.</p>

                            <p>A 3-vs-3 format where teams (Proposition and Opposition) have three speakers each giving 8-minute speeches. It emphasizes clear argumentation, engagement through POIs, and a holistic summary of the debate's key clashes. A key feature is the 4-minute <strong>Reply Speech</strong>, given by either the first or second speaker at the end of the debate, which frames the debate from their side's perspective.</p>

                        <p>CPR is your first step in prep time. It's a brainstorming framework that forces you to define the debate on your terms. By establishing the Context, identifying a clear Problem, and proposing a direct Resolution, you build a coherent case with a strong narrative from the very beginning. Spend the first 2-3 minutes of prep on this.</p>

                        <p>MICE is a framework for analyzing why individuals and groups act the way they do. When you analyze a stakeholder, you can use MICE to predict their behavior by understanding their core motivations. This makes your analysis deeper and more persuasive.</p>

                                <li><strong>Money:</strong> The CEO's primary incentive is to maximize profit. They will resist this motion because content moderation at the scale required is extremely expensive and would reduce profits. Their compensation is tied to stock performance, which is tied to user engagement, and controversial content is often highly engaging.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ideology:</strong> The CEO may genuinely believe in a libertarian interpretation of "free speech," arguing that their platform is a neutral public square and should not be the arbiter of truth. They will frame their opposition to the motion as a defense of this principle.</li>
                                <li><strong>Coercion:</strong> If the law passes, the CEO will be forced to invest heavily in moderation to avoid massive fines and lawsuits. The fear of legal and financial punishment becomes a powerful coercive incentive to change their behavior and police their platform.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ego:</strong> The CEO's self-image is tied to being seen as an innovator and a champion of free expression. They will be motivated to fight the motion to protect this legacy and avoid the public perception of being a censor or a purveyor of harmful content.</li>

                        <p>Rebuttal is the art of dismantling your opponent's arguments. It's not enough to present your own case; you must also show why the other side is wrong.

                            <li><strong>"Therefore..."</strong> - Explain the implication. Why does this rebuttal matter? How does it weaken their case and strengthen yours?</li>

                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Spot It:</strong> Listen for phrases like "So what you're really saying is..." or "So you believe that..." followed by an extreme or simplistic version of your argument.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Use It Strategically:</strong> Call it out directly. "The opposition has built a straw man of our case. They claim we want to [distorted version], but what we actually argued was [your actual point]. Let's debate the real issue." This shows the judge you are the more reasonable and engaged team.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>What It Is:</strong> Attacking the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself. This shifts the focus from the logic of the case to the character of the speaker.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> Focus exclusively on the content of your opponent's speech. Their motivations, background, or character are irrelevant to the truth of their claims.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Spot It:</strong> Any time an opponent criticizes a speaker's personal traits ("You can't trust them, they're a politician") instead of their logic, it's an ad hominem.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Use It Strategically:</strong> "The opposition has spent a minute attacking our team instead of our arguments.

                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>What It Is:</strong> Arguing that a small, initial step will inevitably lead to a chain of related, negative events without providing sufficient evidence for this chain reaction.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> If you want to argue long-term consequences, you must prove each link in the causal chain. Explain the mechanism for why A leads to B, B leads to C, and so on.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Spot It:</strong> Listen for a series of escalating, unsupported claims. "If we allow A, then B will happen, and then C, and soon we'll have Z!"</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Use It Strategically:</strong> "The opposition has presented a slippery slope fallacy. They have not proven why our policy would inevitably lead to these extreme outcomes. They've jumped from A to Z without any analysis of the steps in between. Let's focus on the probable, not the speculative."</p>

                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>What It Is:</strong> Presenting a situation as having only two possible options when, in fact, there are other alternatives. This is often an "either/or" argument that forces a choice between two extremes.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> Acknowledge the nuance and complexity of the issue. Recognize that there may be middle ground or alternative solutions.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Spot It:</strong> When an opponent says, "We have to choose between X and Y," or "It's either our plan or chaos."</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Use It Strategically:</strong> "The other team has presented a false dichotomy. They claim we must choose between their extreme policy and total disaster. This is not true. There is a third, more reasonable option, which is..." This allows you to introduce a more nuanced stance or a counter-model.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>What It Is:</strong> Drawing a broad conclusion based on a small or unrepresentative sample size. A single example is used to prove a general rule.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> Use examples to illustrate a point you've already proven with logic, not as proof itself. If you use an example, explain why it's representative of a wider trend.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Spot It:</strong> When a speaker uses one anecdote to make a sweeping claim. "I know someone who did X, and it was terrible. Therefore, X is always terrible."</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Use It Strategically:</strong> "The opposition's entire argument rests on a single anecdote. This is a hasty generalization. They haven't provided any structural reasons to believe this one case is representative of a broader trend. Our argument, on the other hand, is based on..."</p>

                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>What It Is:</strong> Claiming something must be true simply because a person of authority (or a supposed expert) said it, without any other supporting evidence.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> Use expert opinions as supporting evidence, but always explain the logic behind that opinion. The reasoning is more important than the person who said it.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Spot It:</strong> "As Nobel laureate Dr. X said..." or "The UN report states..." without any further explanation of the data or reasoning.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Use It Strategically:</strong> "While we respect Dr. X, simply stating their conclusion is an appeal to authority, not an argument. The opposition needs to explain the reasoning behind that conclusion for it to have weight in this debate. Without that, it's just an unsubstantiated claim."</p>

                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>What It Is:</strong> Introducing an irrelevant topic or piece of information to divert attention away from the central issue of the debate.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> Stay focused on the core clashes of the debate. Ensure every point you make directly links back to the motion.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Spot It:</strong> When an opponent starts talking about an issue that is only tangentially related to the motion, especially in response to a difficult question or point.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Use It Strategically:</strong> "This is a red herring. The point about [irrelevant topic] may be interesting, but it does not address the central question of this debate, which is [the actual issue]. Let's get back on track." This shows you have control over the direction of the debate.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>What It Is:</strong> An argument that begins with the conclusion it's trying to prove. The premise and the conclusion are the same, just restated in different words.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> Ensure your premises are independent of your conclusion. Your evidence should build towards your claim, not just restate it.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Spot It:</strong> "X is true because of Y, and Y is true because of X." For example, "This policy is good for the economy because it stimulates economic growth."</p>
                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to Use It Strategically:</strong> "The opposition's argument is circular. They've told us their policy is good because it's good, without providing any external mechanism or proof. This is an assertion, not an argument, and should be given no weight."</p>
